Gender equality and economic development are two crucial concepts in social research. Gender equality refers to the fairness and full recognition of both men and women in all aspects of life, including access to opportunities, resources, and power.
The topic "Gender Equality and Economic Development of Nations Worldwide" focuses on the relationship between these two factors and examines the impact of gender equality on the economic development of countries globally (specifically GDP).
This study will investigate the correlation between gender equality indices and economic development indicators across nations worldwide.

## Dataset
